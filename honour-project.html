        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
            We investigate the effectiveness of hedging a European basket options using the Heston Model 
            within a contractual framework involving two parties. The contractual agreement stipulatesthat 
            at a time <i>T</i>, if the value of the stock owned by party one exceeds that of party two, a trade
            occurs. We make use of the Heston Model to optimise the hedging strategy, considering factors
            such as volatility of the respective stocks, co-variation of both stocks with their respective
            variances and co-variation between the two stocks. 
            
            <br /><br />

            Specifically, we explore how covariance between the two underlying stocks, as well as their
            respective covariances with volatilities influence option pricing and hedging outcomes. To 
            estimate the parameters of the Heston Model, our first step is to discretise the model utilising
            Eulerâ€™s discretisation method. Thereafter, employ Maximum Likelihood Estimation on the joint
            multivariate normal distribution of the two stocks to estimate the parameters of the model.
